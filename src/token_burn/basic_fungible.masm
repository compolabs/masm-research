# BASIC FUNGIBLE FAUCET CONTRACT
# =================================================================================================
# This is a basic fungible faucet smart contract.
#
# It allows the owner of the faucet to mint, distribute, and burn tokens. Token metadata is stored
# in account storage at position 1 as [max_supply, decimals, token_symbol, 0], where:
# - max_supply is the maximum supply of the token.
# - decimals are the decimals of the token.
# - token_symbol as three chars encoded in a Felt.

#! Distributes freshly minted fungible assets to the provided recipient.
#! Inputs: [amount, tag, note_type, RECIPIENT]
#! Outputs: [note_ptr, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]
#!
#! - amount is the amount to be minted and sent.
#! - tag is the tag to be included in the note.
#! - note_type is the type of the note that holds the asset.
#! - RECIPIENT is the recipient of the asset, i.e.,
#!   hash(hash(hash(serial_num, [0; 4]), script_hash), input_hash).
#! - note_ptr is the pointer to the memory address in the kernel.
#!   This cannot directly be accessed from another context.
#!
#! FAILS if:
#! - The transaction is being executed against an account that is not a fungible asset faucet.
#! - The total issuance after minting is greater than the maximum allowed supply.
